Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ Youâ€™ve stumbled upon the portfolio of a CS undergrad from IIIT Delhi whoâ€™s mildly obsessed with Vim, kinda skilled at coding, and occasionally funny (at least thatâ€™s the plan). Just a tech student trying to make cool stuff and maybe not break everything in the process.

Graphics, Systems, Networking â€“ these are the areas where I pretend to know what Iâ€™m doing. I love diving into these topics because they make me feel like a wizard, even if sometimes Iâ€™m more of a newbie.

When free, Iâ€™m usually tweaking my vimrc, modding my mechanical keyboard, ricing my distro, and trying to make software _blazingly fast_.
