Hi! I'm Raman, a final year undergraduate at [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in), pursuing a BTech in Computer Science and graduating in May 2025 (hopefully).

My main interests lie in systems and networking. I am learning more about the Linux kernel, focussing on its various subsystems (particularly the network) and device driver development.

I am also interested in data plane programming and have been exploring technologies like P4 and SmartNICs.

At IIIT Delhi, I've had the opportunity to contribute to multiple projects. I was a backend developer for [Enveave](https://enveave.earth), a non-profit environment initiative focused on sustainability. Additionally, I served as a maintainer for multiple institute websites, including the facility hub at [MIDAS Labs](https://midas.iiitd.ac.in/).

Since Fall 2024, I have been working on my B. Tech Thesis titled "AI/ML Workloads for Data Center Networking" under the guidance of [Prof. Rinku Shah](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~rinku/).

In my free time, I enjoy playing basketball and watching NBA streams (mostly highlights). Also recently started getting into Powerlifting. You can often find me strolling around campus, trying to hit my daily step count.
